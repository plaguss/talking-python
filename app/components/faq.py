        ## How does Explore Talking Python work?
        The podcast's transcripts have been embedded in a [chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/)
        database that allows for semantic search and retrieval.
        **ADD GUIDE TO THE PROCESS**

        When you upload a document, it will be divided into smaller chunks 
        and stored in a special type of database called a vector index 
        that allows for semantic search and retrieval.

        When you ask a question, the model finds the nearest passage of text
        in the podcast's transcripts and suggests the most similar.
        **NEEDS A FUNCTION TO SORT THE RESULTS. THE MAX, SOME KIND OF AVERAGE?**
