        ## How does Explore Talk Python To Me work?
        The podcast's transcripts have been embedded in a [chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/)
        database that allows for semantic search and retrieval. When you insert
        a question, the text is embedded, and chroma is in charge of finding
        the most similar pieces of content to show.

        ## In need of inspiration? Here are some ideas
        - how to run machine learning models in production
        - rich and terminal user interfaces
        - content about the python package ecosystem
