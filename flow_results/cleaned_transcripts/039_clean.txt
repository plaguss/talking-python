Hello and welcome to a special Talk Python To Me. In this Talk Python, we are not going to interview one person that's maybe done something great in the industry; this is in fact going to be a two part series made up of panelists. And the idea is- we are going to talk about how do you get started in the software industry in general and in Python as a Python developer in particular. So the overall goal of the series is going to be to help newcomers whether they are entirely new to the development world, or maybe transitioning from a related industry, like going from networking into programming, help those newcomers get their first job. We are going to interview some people who have just landed their first job, and we are going to interview some people who have key roles hiring and selecting candidates at their companies. So this is going to be a two part series. Part one, we are going to talk to the newcomers, everyone here on the show today has just got a new job and we are going to talk about their experience getting in there and then in the following show we are going to talk to the experts.
Now, I think one of the challenges out in the software industry is there is a large disconnect between people who have experience and people who are just getting started. If you have experience and you have done good work previously in the software industry, getting the job is pretty easy to be honest, just from my experience, I have received job offers unsolicited by the way, job offers all the time, I just have one in my inbox right now, "hey, here is a great job $150000 plus bonuses, cool technology, lifestyle balance, you don't have to work all the time." You know, it sounds great but I am not interested, I actually already have a job and I like it! So in some sense there is this feeling that there are many tech jobs out there, there are not enough programmers to actually fill the jobs and there is just tons of competition for good developers.
But on the other side of that story is, I think it fairly hard for people getting into the industry to get started- how do they differentiate themselves, how do they prove that they are good bets, things like that. I feel kind of once you get started in the software industry it's and as long as you put in the effort you keep learning, you keep growing, it's super easy to have a good job and just run with it. But getting that first step, that first foot hold can be a super big challenge, so I am hoping to put together the series to help more people climb that first step and get off the ground and running maybe quicker, maybe easier than they would have otherwise.
So, let me introduce the panelists real quick: this week we are going to have Jess Unrein, Justin Beall, Eric Chou, Jonathan Sundqvist, Hellio Correia and Matt Yancey. Next week, we will hear from experts at companies such as Netflix and PayPal, among others.
Now, before we get to this panelist discussion, I want to recommend a few books. Now, I am sure you are all aware of many ways to learn what you need to get a programming job, right, we can take online classes, you can go to a university program, you could buy a book on Flask, you can buy a book on SQLAlchemy, but what I think people sometimes overlook are books that are a little more focused on taking the step back and looking at their career as a technical person. So I want to recommend two books that changed my thinking on this, to some degree. The first one is a book called "Soft Skills- The Software Developer's Life Manual", and this is a super good book by John Sonmez, I'll put the links in the show notes to both of these books I recommend. And this book by John Sonmez really talks about how do you build up your career so that you distinguish yourself, how do you specialize in something and how do you make that known, and he really covers what you need to sort of grow into being a very successful software developers outside the technical parts which are I think sometimes difficult, but more straight forward to learn.
The second book I want to recommend is a book called, "The End Of Jobs: Money, Meaning and Freedom Without the 9-to-5" by a guy named Taylor Pearson. So, this is one of my favorite books I've read this year- it's not exactly how do you get better at your job, but a little bit more how do you look at employment and work for yourself in general. So, to give you a sense, I'll give you a little quote from the book, and there is a part where he talks about people are having a hard time finding the job, doing the certain thing they want or maybe at the right pay level or the right flexibility or something like that, and says something to the effect of, "The problem both for us as the society and as individuals is that we are asking the wrong question- how do I get that job? What if a better question is- how do I create a job doing that?" Taylor goes through sort of analyzing the tech space and talks about entrepreneurship. I think you'll get a fresh perspective on careers and employment and jobs and all those sorts of things. I'm not sure it's super helpful when you are first getting started, but it's definitely interesting big picture book that I think fits into this conversation.
In this first segment, I wanted to lay the groundwork to build all the rest of the conversation on, so I asked everybody who is participating- what job did they just land. Pretty much everyone you are going to talk to has a new job, many of them- it's their first or one of their first programming jobs. So, I ask what job did you land, what kind of experience were they looking for, and what type of people and software will you be working on?

Here is Eric Chou who is working on the Microsoft Azure Cloud computing team.

Now let's hear from Jonathan Sundqvist, who just landed his first job at "Server Density".
Jonathan Sundqvist
Next up is Justin Beall, and Justin's situation is a little bit different than the other guys'. Justin has been working as a software developer in the Java space but he decided to make a transition over to Python so in some sense he is brand new and in some sense- he has a lot of experience. Let's hear what he has to say.
Justin Beall
Next up is Hellio Coreia. Hellio is a little concerned that his English was maybe not quite up to interview format in English, but I really wanted to include a story because I think it's an interesting one and it's somewhat different and will probably resonate with some of you out there. Hellio is from Portugal, and as you may know, Portugal has had some really tough times with their economy; right now the unemployment is 11.9% and that's much better than it has been over the last few years, there was somewhere close to 20%. When you are in that kind of market finding a job takes on a different set of challenges. And to that, Hellio lives out in the country, in a small town and he is looking for a job as a software developer and doesn't really want to move to the major cities where you probably can find jobs pretty easily but then you would live in the middle of the city and that's not the lifestyle he wants. So, his story is about how do you take this sort of tough situation as well as geographically located in places that may be a little harder to find Python jobs and make it work. Here is Hellio.

Our final guest is Matt Yancey. And Matt will bring us the data science side of the Python story.

The next thing I want to explore with our group is what did they do to prepare for this position? So, everybody  you are hearing from has recently landed a job that is at least some major transition if not an entirely new career for them. And so what did they do? Did they go to the university, study for 4 years and get some well nice well rounded education, but 4 years of hard work before you can see whether that is going to work out? Or did they do some online video courses, did they read book, did they work on side projects. Where I work, we interview a lot of people, but we hire very few junior developers. Generally, everyone I work with is a software trainer so we teach people who are already experienced software developers something new that they don't know so that doesn't really fit the mold of helping someone get their first job. You have to come with experience. In my world, we don't look at degrees, we don't really care so much about what you studied and a lot of plaques and certifications. We just want to know what have you done and how can you present that? But I wanted to ask everybody here what they tried and what worked because they are in a very different position to the experience I have. Here is Jess again.

Now let's hear from Matt Yancey.
Matt Yancey
So you have heard the different approaches that our new hires have taken. Some of them did bootcamps, some of them did online courses, some of them just built it up solely over time and we have a master's degree in the mix there. So I asked what do you think of your particular path to getting ready to get this job and get started in this industry was the most important?

Keeping with the theme that I would like to help everyone out there looking for a job or trying to get into career, trying to help them be successful, I asked our panelists what it was about their experience or them or the interview process that they felt was key to them actually landing this job they are in. So let's hear what they have to say.
Jess Unrein
Eric Chou
Jonathan Sundkvist
Justin Beall
In this last question, I basically asked the panelists to speak directly to you, developers and potential developers or soon to be developers, about what advice they have for you to help you get started. Here they are:
